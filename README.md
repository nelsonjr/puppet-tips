# Puppet Trips & Tricks

This repository contains step-by-step instructions and tips for Puppet users.

### Why Puppet?

Puppet helps automate deployment, and has a vast selection of powerful
deployment [modules][] ready for use. We'll leverage those modules to create a
simple, easy to maintain, and reliable deployment setup.
